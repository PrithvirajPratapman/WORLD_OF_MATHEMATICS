            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data. By analyzing patterns and making inferences, machine learning algorithms can improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</p>
            <p>The concept of machine learning dates back to the mid-20th century, but it gained significant traction in the 2000s due to the increased availability of data, computational power, and more sophisticated algorithms. Today, ML is integral to many technological applications, from self-driving cars and facial recognition to recommendation systems and automated medical diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>Core Concepts in Machine Learning</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
                <p>In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. Each input data point is associated with a corresponding output (label). The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be generalized to new, unseen data.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Image classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis.</p>
                <p>Common algorithms used in supervised learning include decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</p>

            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms are given input data without explicit labels. The goal is to identify underlying structures or patterns in the data, such as grouping similar data points together (clustering) or reducing the dimensionality of the data.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, feature extraction.</p>
                <p>Algorithms in unsupervised learning include k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised or unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is based on trial and error, with the agent learning from the consequences of its actions.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, autonomous driving, optimization problems.</p>
                <p>Algorithms used in RL include Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, involves neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These algorithms are particularly powerful at learning complex patterns in data, such as recognizing faces in images or understanding speech. Deep learning has gained tremendous attention due to its success in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Models:</strong> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers.</p>
